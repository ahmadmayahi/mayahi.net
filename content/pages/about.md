Hello everybody,

My name is Ahmad Mayahi, I was born in 1986 in Iraq, I live and work in Denmark.

Being in love with programming in my whole life, back to 2000 I wrote my first application by using QBasic, then Visual basic and I ended up with Borland Delphi before I switch to web development field.

In 2004 I discovered PHP and since then I use PHP in web projects.

I find PHP to be scalable and easy to use. I have been using it for over ten years to create professional websites.

Additionally, I’m a certified PHP Engineer from Zend (the PHP company).

Besides PHP, I have a lot of experience with many technologies.

- Linux administration (Ubuntu).
- Git.
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, Memcached.
- Elasticsearch
- NGINX and Apache.
- Docker.
- Amazon Web Services (S3, EC2, RDS, Route53, VPC, etc…)
- Laravel, Symfony.
- Python, Flask.
- HTML/CSS (of course 😀).
- JavaScript.

In this blog, I’m writing about all these technologies, sometimes you’ll see more focus on some of them, like PHP than others.

Please feel free to contact me, if you have any suggestions/questions.

Best,

Ahmad Mayahi
